To see it in use,\r\ncheck out [clarkduvall.com](http://clarkduvall.com).\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nMost of this was written awhile ago when I knew JavaScript about as well as I\r\nknow Spanish (which is a little, but not much). It is due for a rewrite with\r\nsome cool new features like pipes, writable files, and other magic.\r\n\r\n## How To Use\r\nAt the bottom of the [js/jsterm.js](js/jsterm.js) file,\r\nthere is a series of term.enqueue() calls. This is where the commands are set\r\nthat are run when the page loads. Other changes can be made to personalize your\r\nterminal. The directory structure is as follows:\r\n- [commands](commands) - A JS file with all the possible\r\n  commands that can be run. Add new commands here.\r\n- [config](config) - A JS file that has basic configuration\r\n  information. Change things like the prompt here.\r\n- [css](css) - The CSS used on the page.\r\n- [images](images) - Image files used in your filesystem.\r\n- [js](js) - The jsterm implementation.\r\n- [json](json) - Where the filesystem is stored. Change the\r\n  term.Init() call in [js/jsterm.js](js/jsterm.js) to change\r\n  which filesystem is loaded.\r\n\r\nFor the loading of the filesytem to work locally, you must server the files in\r\nthe directory from a local server. To do this easily, change into the jsterm\r\ndirectory and run:\r\n```\r\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Filesystem Format\r\nA filesystem is a recursive grouping of JSON arrays of objects. Each nested\r\narray represents the listing of items in a directory. Each object in the array\r\ndefines a file or directory. For an example, see\r\n[json/sample.json](json/sample.json).\r\n\r\n## make_fs.py\r\nThis is a script that will create a jsterm filesystem from a real directory.\r\nExamples of how to make different file types are as follows:\r\n- Text file (no execute permissions):\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is a text file.\r\n```\r\n- Executable/link (MUST BE MARKED EXECUTABLE):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://google.com\r\n```\r\n- Image file: can be any image file with a standard extension (e.g. .png, .jpg)\r\n\r\n## Attribution\r\nIf you use jsterm, it would be great if you could link to this GitHub repo. Thanks!\r\n","google":"UA-45550231-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
